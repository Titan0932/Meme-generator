# Meme-generator
This generates a random meme from 7 popular sub-reddits, along with the upvote and downvote numbers, and user. Also, each time you refresh the page, the theme colors get reversed. This was made using Flask, html, css and a little bit of javascript..

If you want to use it, make sure the directories are in order, create your own reddit app, get the username and secret key and assign it to the variables in the main.py file. 

P.S in 'main.py' I have a loop to decrypt the reddit password extracted from password.txt. The encryption is very simple: just the ascii value of each letter of the code.
